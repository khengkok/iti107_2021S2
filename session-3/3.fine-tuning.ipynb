    "Another widely used technique is _fine-tuning_. \n",
    "Fine-tuning consists in unfreezing a few of the top layers \n",
    "of a frozen model base used for feature extraction, and jointly training both the newly added part of the model (in our case, the \n",
    "fully-connected classifier) and these top layers. This is called \"fine-tuning\" because it slightly adjusts the more abstract \n",
    "representations of the model being reused, in order to make them more relevant for the problem at hand.\n",

    "We have stated before that it was necessary to freeze the convolution base of VGG16 in order to be able to train a randomly initialized \n",
    "classifier on top. For the same reason, it is only possible to fine-tune the top layers of the convolutional base once the classifier on \n",
    "top has already been trained. If the classified wasn't already trained, then the error signal propagating through the network during \n",
    "training would be too large, and the representations previously learned by the layers being fine-tuned would be destroyed. Thus the steps \n",
    "for fine-tuning a network are as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1) Add your custom network on top of an already trained base network.\n",
    "* 2) Freeze the base network.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Earlier layers in the convolutional base encode more generic, reusable features, while layers higher up encode more specialized features. It is \n",
